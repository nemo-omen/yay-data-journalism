My own list of great data-journalism and dataviz resources, tutorials, frameworks etc.


## Tutorials


### Ben Welsh Tutorials

This is a great set of tutorials by LA Times Data Editor, Ben Welsh

[First Web Scraper](https://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- the basics of web-scraping with Python

[First News App](https://first-news-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- creating a simple Flask app

[First Python Notebook](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org) -- working with Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook for data-journalism

[First Graphics App](https://www.firstgraphics.app) -- simple graphics app made with Bootstrap, Nunjucks, D3, and Leaflet

[First Django Admin](https://first-django-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- set up a Django admin to allow users to input data into a database. According to Ben, "You will learn just enough about the Django framework to design database tables, load in data and create an administration panel for others to improve it. You will not bother with all the other web developer crap."
